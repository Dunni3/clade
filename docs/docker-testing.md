# Docker Compose Test Environment

A multi-container environment for testing the full `clade` CLI onboarding flow — `clade init`, `clade add-brother`, `clade status`, and `clade doctor` — without needing real SSH hosts or a deployed Hearth server.

## Architecture

Three containers on a shared Docker network:

| Container | Role | What it runs |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `personal` | Personal brother (coordinator) | clade CLI, Claude Code, SSH client |
| `worker` | Worker brother (SSH target) | sshd, Claude Code, python3, git, tmux |
| `hearth` | Communication hub | FastAPI + uvicorn (hearth server), Claude Code |

Docker Compose DNS lets `personal` reach `worker` and `hearth` by service name.

```

└─────────────┘
```

## Quick Start

```bash
bash scripts/test-compose.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate throwaway SSH keys in `test-keys/` (if not already present)
2. Build all three container images
3. Start the containers in the background
4. Drop you into a bash shell on the `personal` container

Claude Code is pre-installed but **not authenticated**. Run `claude login` inside each container to log in with your account. This must be done manually after each rebuild — login state does not persist across container rebuilds.

```bash
# Authenticate Claude Code (interactive — opens a browser URL to complete)
claude login
```

From there, run the onboarding flow:

```bash
clade init --name "Test Clade" --personal-name darwin --server-url http://hearth:8000 --server-key testkey-personal -y
clade add-brother --ssh testuser@worker --name curie -y
clade status
clade doctor
```

The `--server-key testkey-personal` flag bootstraps the first key registration: darwin's generated key gets registered with the Hearth using the pre-configured test key. After that, `add-brother` uses darwin's key to register curie's key automatically.

## Files

All Docker files live in `docker/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker/Dockerfile.test` | Personal brother image — clade CLI, SSH client with pre-loaded key |
| `docker/Dockerfile.test.worker` | Worker brother image — sshd with authorized key, git, tmux |
| `docker/Dockerfile.test.hearth` | Hearth server image — FastAPI + uvicorn + aiosqlite |
| `docker/docker-compose.test.yml` | Wires the three services together |
| `scripts/test-compose.sh` | Convenience launcher (keygen + build + start + attach) |
| `test-keys/` | Generated SSH keypair (gitignored) |

## SSH Key Exchange

The personal and worker containers share a throwaway ed25519 keypair:

- `test-keys/id_ed25519` → copied into `personal` at `/home/testuser/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- `test-keys/id_ed25519.pub` → copied into `worker` at `/home/testuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`

Keys are generated by `scripts/test-compose.sh` on first run. The `test-keys/` directory is gitignored — delete it to regenerate.

The personal container also has `StrictHostKeyChecking no` configured for the `worker` host so SSH connects without prompting.

## Hearth Server

The hearth container runs the real Hearth FastAPI server from `hearth/`. It comes pre-configured with two test API keys:

| Key | Name | For |
|-----|------|-----|
| `testkey-personal` | `testpersonal` | Personal container (set via env vars) |
| `testkey-worker` | `testworker` | Worker container |

The personal container has `HEARTH_URL`, `HEARTH_API_KEY`, and `HEARTH_NAME` set in its environment, so the MCP server would connect automatically if running.

To test the Hearth API directly:

```bash
# From inside the personal container:
curl http://hearth:8000/api/v1/messages -H "Authorization: Bearer testkey-personal"
```

## What Gets Tested

### `clade init`
- Config file creation (`~/.config/clade/clade.yaml`)
- API key generation (`~/.config/clade/keys.json`)

### `clade add-brother`

| Step | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|
| SSH test | `ssh testuser@worker echo ok` succeeds via Docker network |
| Prereq check | python3 OK, git OK, tmux OK, claude OK |
| Deploy | Skipped with `--no-deploy` (or: clade is pre-installed on worker) |
| API key gen | Creates key in `~/.config/clade/keys.json` |
| Config update | Adds brother to `~/.config/clade/clade.yaml` |

### `clade status` / `clade doctor`
Runs diagnostics across all brothers and the server. Some expected failures in the test environment:
- **Server shows DOWN**: The Hearth has no `/api/v1/health` endpoint; status falls back to checking `/` which also 404s. The API itself works fine.
- **MCP not registered**: Expected when using `--no-mcp`.
- **Identity not found**: Expected when using `--no-identity`.

## Common Operations

```bash
# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up --build -d

# Attach to the personal container
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml exec personal bash

# View hearth logs
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml logs hearth

# SSH from personal to worker manually
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml exec personal ssh testuser@worker

# Stop everything
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml down

# Stop and remove volumes (reset hearth DB)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml down -v

# Regenerate SSH keys
rm -rf test-keys && bash scripts/test-compose.sh
```

## Claude Code Authentication

Claude Code is installed on all containers at build time, but authentication must be done manually after each rebuild. Run `claude login` inside each container — it will print a URL to open in your browser to complete OAuth.

```bash
# Personal — you're already here after test-compose.sh drops you in
claude login

# Worker — SSH from inside the personal container
ssh testuser@worker
claude login

# Hearth — use docker compose exec from the host machine
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml exec hearth bash
claude login
```

Login state lives in `~/.claude/` inside the container and is lost when the container is rebuilt. To persist it across rebuilds, you could volume-mount the auth directory, but this is generally not needed for quick test sessions.

## Limitations

- **Claude Code login is ephemeral**: `claude login` must be re-run after each container rebuild.
- **Hearth API key bootstrap**: The pre-configured test keys in `docker/docker-compose.test.yml` are used to bootstrap. Keys generated by `clade init --server-key` and `clade add-brother` are dynamically registered with the Hearth via its `/api/v1/keys` endpoint.
